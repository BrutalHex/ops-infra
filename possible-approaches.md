# Introduction
There are several factors to consider when choosing a technology stack that provides a comprehensive DBaaS (Database-as-a-Service) solution.
For each aspect, multiple options are available. 
Below, I've highlighted a few key areas along with potential choices for each. This is not an exhaustive listâ€”just a selection of some, relevant topics.

## Cloud Hypercaler Options
You can set up your Kubernetes clusters using one of the following approaches:

### Option 1: Two Clusters on Two Different Cloud Providers  
Example: One in AWS, another in Azure

**Pros:**
- High availability across cloud providers  
- Diverse operational knowledge  
- Strong resiliency against provider-specific outages  

**Cons:**
- Complex infrastructure as code (e.g., each provider's DNS and networking APIs differ)  
- Complicated routing policies  
- Challenging security configurations  
- Higher support and integration costs  

---

### Option 2: Two Clusters in Different Regions of a Single Cloud Provider  
Example: Both clusters are in AWS, but in different regions.

**Pros:**
- Simpler setup and configuration  
- Unified routing and DNS policies  
- Easier security policy enforcement  

**Cons:**
- Susceptible to global outages (e.g., Cloudflare incident on November 2, 2023)  
- Vendor lock-in risks  

---

## Firewall and edge security
One of the most important parts of infrastructure security is the edge firewall and DDoS protection.

### Option 1: Cloudflare
Cloudflare provides globally distributed edge protection with built-in DDoS mitigation, web application firewall (WAF), bot management, and CDN capabilities. It is cloud-agnostic and easy to integrate.

**Pros:**
- Global low-latency protection
- Strong DDoS mitigation
- Easy DNS-based integration
- Managed WAF with rich rulesets
- Extra services like Zero Trust access

**Cons:**
- Adds external dependency
- May conflict with cloud-native ingress policies

---

### Option 2: AWS Firewall & Shield or Azure Firewall
These are native cloud offerings that provide DDoS protection and firewalling within the same cloud provider ecosystem. AWS Shield integrates with WAF and Route 53, while Azure provides similar controls.

**Pros:**
- Seamless integration with cloud-native infrastructure
- Lower latency inside the provider network
- Centralized billing and management
- Strong SLA-backed DDoS protection (Shield Advanced)

**Cons:**
- Tied to a single provider.
- Complex setup for multi-region or hybrid environments.
- Complex setup for the redundant cloud provider.
---

## Monitoring
Monitoring is essential for understanding system health, usage patterns, and detecting anomalies in real-time.

### Option 1: Prometheus + Grafana + Thanos
This stack is a popular open-source, self-managed solution for monitoring Kubernetes and cloud-native environments.

**Pros:**
- Fully open-source and highly customizable
- Prometheus provides powerful metrics collection
- Grafana offers rich visualization and alerting
- Thanos enables long-term storage and multi-cluster aggregation
- Cloud-agnostic

**Cons:**
- Operational overhead to manage and scale components
- Requires persistent storage for Thanos
- Complex for large-scale setups

---

### Option 2: Cloud-Based Monitoring (e.g., AWS CloudWatch, Azure Monitor)
These services offer integrated monitoring for resources deployed within the respective cloud providers.

**Pros:**
- No setup or maintenance required
- Seamless integration with native services
- Includes logging, metrics, and tracing in one suite
- Scalable with minimal effort

**Cons:**
- Vendor lock-in
- May lack deep Kubernetes observability
- Can become costly with high metric volumes

---
## Log Management

Log management is critical for debugging, auditing, and security observability. Below are common approaches:

### Option 1: Loki + OpenTelemetry
Loki is a horizontally scalable, highly available log aggregation system inspired by Prometheus. It works well with Grafana and can ingest logs via OpenTelemetry.

**Pros:**
- Easy integration with Grafana dashboards
- Lightweight and efficient for Kubernetes logs
- Compatible with OpenTelemetry for unified observability
- Open-source and cloud-agnostic

**Cons:**
- Limited support for full-text search
- Less mature than the ELK stack for enterprise environments

---

### Option 2: Elasticsearch + Logstash + Kibana (ELK Stack)
The ELK stack is a mature and flexible solution for collecting, storing, and analyzing logs.

**Pros:**
- Powerful full-text search and filtering
- Kibana provides advanced analytics and visualization
- Highly scalable for large log volumes

**Cons:**
- Operationally heavy and resource-intensive
- Complex to scale and secure

---

### Option 3: Cloud-Based Logging (e.g., AWS CloudWatch, Azure Monitor Logs)
Managed logging services that integrate seamlessly with cloud-native workloads.

**Pros:**
- No infrastructure to manage
- Seamless integration with cloud services
- Centralized logs with alerting and analytics

**Cons:**
- Vendor lock-in
- Limited customization and flexibility
- Potentially high cost for large log volumes
